            As we dreamed every day in childhood, we have been craving for them. We dreamed that we can drive the spaceship that is from the Star War to go anywhere in a few seconds. We dreamed that we can go traveling by train so that we can enjoy the landscapes on the road. Even though they are from our dream but they did accompany us for a long long time. Thus, we go learn 3D modeling and Illustrator so that we can have them on the computer. As what we like is more complex than before, we have to upgrade our skills to make them. All of those 3D works make through cinema4D.
